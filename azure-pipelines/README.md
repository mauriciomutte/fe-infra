# Azure Pipelines: CI/CD using YML with templates

## 1. What is Azure Pipelines?

- Azure Pipelines is continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)
- Enables teams to continuously build, test, and deploy applications
- It is part of the Azure DevOps Services suite of tools

## 2. What pain does it solve?

### CI/CD

- Improve software quality by detecting errors and bugs early on.
- Reduce repetitive manual work, freeing up developers to focus on more important tasks.

### Templates

- **Reuse and consistency:** Using YAML pipeline templates enables defining reusable building blocks that can be used across multiple pipelines, improving consistency and reducing duplication.
- **Simplify pipeline creation:** Allows developers to use existing standardized templates for new pipeline creation.
- **Collaboration:** Storing pipelines on Github makes any changes visible and allows for more efficient collaboration with others.
